**GTA 5 Enhanced Cheats** are advanced cheat codes or tools designed to provide players with additional abilities and features not available in the base game. These cheats are often created by modders to offer a more customized and varied experience. Unlike the standard in-game cheats, enhanced cheats can unlock powerful options that significantly alter gameplay.

### Key Features:
1. **Unlimited Resources**: Players can gain unlimited health, ammo, money, or vehicles, making it easier to explore the game or complete challenges without restrictions.
   
2. **Advanced Abilities**: Some cheats grant abilities like super speed, flying, or invincibility, providing a more over-the-top and chaotic gameplay experience.
   
3. **Weapon and Vehicle Modifications**: Enhanced cheats often give players access to new weapons or vehicles that aren't available through regular gameplay, expanding the game's arsenal and transportation options.

4. **World Alteration**: Cheats can modify the game world itself, such as changing the weather, time of day, or the behavior of NPCs, allowing for creative experimentation.

5. **Customizable Features**: Many enhanced cheats allow users to tweak and adjust settings, such as adjusting the strength of certain effects or adding new functions not normally included in the game.

6. **Script-Based Mods**: Some of these cheats are built using custom scripts or modding tools, offering more complexity and the ability to create a truly personalized experience in GTA 5.

While **GTA 5 Enhanced Cheats** can make the game more fun and allow for creative freedom, using them in multiplayer can lead to bans or account suspensions, as they provide an unfair advantage. It is always important to use these cheats responsibly and consider the impact on your gaming experience.
